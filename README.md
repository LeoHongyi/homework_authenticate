##business logic mapping:
1、 create / delete user -> router user.router.js
2. create / delete role -> router role.router.js
3. authenticate user -> router user.router.js
4. validate user -> router user.router.js
5. check role by username -> router role.router.js after get authenticated user
6. checkout all roles by username -> router role.router.js after authenticate user

###api detail:

##how to run project
1. how to generate public and private key

3. how to run the code 
```
npm run dev

```

4. how to test
